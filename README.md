# PostHog Capture API SDKs

As explained in our API overview page, PostHog provides two different APIs.  This page refers to our public endpoints, which use the same API key as the PostHog snippet. The endpoints documented here are used solely with POST requests, and will not return any sensitive data from your PostHog instance.

## Installation

For installation please see instructions on fetching from package managers for each langauge specific SDK.

## Requirements

## Authentication

To authenticate the Posthog SDKs you will need to provide a [Posthog API Token](https://posthog.com/docs/api#authentication). PostHog expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server.
